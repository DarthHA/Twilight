This mod adds Twilight from Library of Ruina/Lobotomy Corporation.
This item is unobtainable now. You can use cheating mod (like Heros) to get it.
Due to technical limitations and perception requirements, some original features have been modified.
Don't be surprised by the size of this mod, it's totally worth it lol.
Ported from 1.3 of the same mod. This mod may has bugs and doesn't support multiplayer.
